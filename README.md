# TMDBMovies
## This is a simple iOS app that consumes the “The Movie Database API” 


- The project uses a very simple UI, UITabViewController as the root of the app.  There are UINavigationControllers embedded inside the UITabViewController to wrap each tab of the root.  

- This project uses Storyboards and UIKit so that the project can bet targeted for iOS versions older than 13.0

- The app uses [SD WebImage library](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) for downloading the poster images. 

- I would like to upgrade the app to use SwiftUI and Combine framework in the future.
